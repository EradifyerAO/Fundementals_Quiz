This is a basic 10-question quiz app to showcase Javascript integrated into a webpage styled with CSS. The content of the quiz is 3d modeling fundementals.

HTML
<br>
This is a basic html setup. However, one distinct difference from this website and prior website projects I've done is a <script></script> reference. This is the essential link that allows Javascript to function on the webpage.

CSS
<br>
I created a seperate CSS file for this project. I was given some bare essentials to get a basic aesthetic working on the page, but I wanted to create a visual theme that was more intriquing to users of the app.

JAVASCRIPT
<br>
The core functionality happens here. I created a seperate file for the javascript code. The question data takes up a good deal of the space since I decided to use ten questions in the quiz.

FLOWCHART
<br>
Due to a great deal of difficulty I had with understanding how the Javascript code functioned, I elected to recreate the assignment-included flowchart. It includes all of the code the app needs to function. Since I am a visual learner, this allowed me to break the code down into it's smaller components to help me understand what was going on.
